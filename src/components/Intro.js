    <h2>Hey CSS, what have you been up to lately?</h2>
    <p>
      Oh really, <code>@container</code>? Oh and intrinsic sizing? And <code>@property</code> too?! Wow, you've been
      busy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the pandemic kept on making everybody's lives harder throughout 2021, somehow dedicated contributors
      around the world managed to keep CSS moving forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so once more it's time to survey the CSS ecosystem and figure out where this is all goingâ€¦ and maybe learn
      about a few new things while you're at it!
    </p>
